3 int lists shown in random order (each individual list containing the correct password)

Agent 1, 2 and 3 all have different passwords that can be changed and then entered respectivley

the ADMINPASSWORD is simply the addition of different locations in the int list (if Agent 2 is changed, I have made it so that the ADMINPASSWORD is also changed, for a little extra challenge)

Typing I AM THE ADMIN when it asks for your user name for changing the password will lead you to an area where you can see the current ADMINPASSWORD (changes the default in Agent 2's password is already changed in that runtime)

This project took me a month and involved alot of looking back on what I have already learned, I am open to all feedback!
